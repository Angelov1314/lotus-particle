An interactive 3D particle art installation featuring a lotus flower model controlled by hand gestures via webcam. Built with Three.js and MediaPipe -- no build tools required.

**[Live Demo](https://angelov1314.github.io/3D-Particle-simulator/)**

## Features

- **Hand Gesture Control** -- sculpt and interact with particles using your webcam via MediaPipe Hands
- **3D GLB Model Loading** -- load any `.glb` model and explode/reconstruct it as a particle system
- **Real-time Sculpting** -- push, pull, and deform particles with an adjustable brush
- **Particle Presets** -- switch between visual styles (spiral, vortex, grid, noise, etc.)
- **Drag & Drop** -- drop a `.glb` file directly onto the canvas to load it
- **Ambient Music** -- built-in audio player with volume control
- **Fullscreen Mode** -- UI fades on idle, reappears on mouse movement
- **Color Customization** -- per-particle color and background color controls

## Getting Started

Open `index.html` in a modern browser. For webcam access, serve locally:

```bash
npx serve .
# or
python3 -m http.server
```

Allow webcam access when prompted. Use your hand in front of the camera to interact with the particle field.
